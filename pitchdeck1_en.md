## Customer problem:
Simple and low-cost monitoring systems generate lots of notifications, generate false alarms or miss important events.
- Can you fully trust a system that generates lots of notifications, some of which are sometimes false?
Lack of easy interaction and prioritisation makes us unable to trust the technology, which requires constant monitoring and costs time and money.
